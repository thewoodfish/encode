  Elect-"0"-Rate is a blockchain solution that solves the election manipulation problem and ENSURES ABSOLUTELY, a free and fair election.<br>
  It is built with <a href="https://use.ink">ink!</a> - a rust eDSL for writing smart contracts.

# Elect-"0"-Rate Contract Node
This blockchain node is important as it runs the Elect-"0"-Rate contratct ehich manages all the election process transparently and securely. It records the election entry, votes, caches voters BVNs and provides critical information when queried etc. 

## Running a local Elect-"0"-Rate contract node 
- Check out the guidelines to setup a local contracts node <a href="https://use.ink/getting-started/setup">here</a>.
- Clone this repo and use the code here as your contract code.
- Deploy and begin testing your contract.

## Going forward
One major feature to be added is emitting of events by the contract.

### Final
So all in all, in the nearest future, when you find yourself voting for your next leader through Elect-"0"-Rate or it's derivatives, just smile and say to yourself "I AM SAFE, I AM HEARD". Then go home, have a nice dinner and go to bed knowing that no magic can tamper with the election.

Thank you for your time, God bless you! ❤️
